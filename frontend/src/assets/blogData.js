        title: "Forever isn’t enough",
        content: 'When I say “What if we had more time,” I don’t mean a few extra days or years. I mean centuries. Imagine living for hundreds, even thousands of years. Imagine time no longer being a scarcity — what would that do to our choices? Would we finally heal, finally chase purpose, finally become the people we were meant to be?Or would we keep delaying everything that matters — endlessly postponing change, growth, and forgiveness because there’s always more time?This thought isn’t about science fiction or fantasy. It’s about asking ourselves: If time were no longer limited… would we really live differently? Or would we suffer longer, hide deeper, and run further — because now, death isn’t knocking, and urgency is gone?What if we had more time?Would we finally live the lives we were meant to — or simply prolong the illusion of becoming? Would we find the courage to chase meaning, or just decorate our delays with distractions?We often believe that more time means more life. But time doesn’t grant life — purpose does. You can exist for a hundred years and still not have lived a single day with intention. Purpose gives weight to every passing moment, while time alone just lets it slip.If we had more time, would we heal the wounds we’ve buried deep? Or simply dig new ones, thinking we still have forever?We all carry a kind of quiet suffering — disappointments, betrayals, guilt, shame. We tell ourselves, “Someday, when things settle, I’ll fix this. I’ll feel this. I’ll heal this.” But that “someday” keeps shifting further, hidden behind responsibilities, comfort zones, or fear of reopening what hurts.Take, for example, a man named Arjun.He lost his father at sixteen, and never cried. Never spoke of it. He buried the grief beneath performance, perfection, and people-pleasing. Every year he told himself he’d sit with it, write about it, forgive himself for not being strong enough to say goodbye. But he never did. Not at 30. Not at 50. Not even at 85.He lived a long life. But not once did he really grieve.And so, even as his body aged, that 16-year-old boy lived on inside him — quiet, aching, and unheard.More time didn’t heal him. It simply made his silence heavier.“Without urgency, we postpone meaning.”For a long time, I believed that time heals everything.But now I see it differently: time doesn’t heal anything — the will to heal does. A man can live a hundred years and never stop bleeding inside. Longevity doesn’t mend the soul; choice does. Awareness does. The courage to face what hurts, to step into discomfort, to begin again — that’s what brings healing.If time alone could heal, why are suicides rising?This is not to justify such endings — only to show that simply living longer is not the answer. Pain ignored doesn’t vanish; it multiplies. And the longer we run from it, the deeper it roots itself in us.This is why urgency matters.Urgency isn’t just pressure — it’s purpose in motion.It is the quiet reminder that time is slipping — and with it, so are chances. The truth is, the brevity of life is what makes it beautiful. Deadlines make dreams real. Mortality makes moments sacred. When we know our days are numbered, we’re forced to choose — to feel, to forgive, to create, to live fully now.Without urgency, we postpone meaning.Without the ticking clock, we let our souls sleep.So maybe we don’t need more time.We need more clarity.More truth.More purpose.More reasons to rise beyond the ordinary.More strength to confront what bleeds beneath the surface.More urgency — not to rush, but to awaken.Because maybe the answer isn’t in having longer days —but in having deeper reasons to live them, and the will to make those days count.',

        title: "The Moment I Realized It Wasn’t Attachment",
        content: "There are nights when the heart whispers questions the mind is too afraid to answer.Nights when a single thought spills into a thousand doubts:“Do I love her… or am I simply holding onto something familiar ?”It’s strange how love hides itself.Not always in fireworks,not in the dramatic pull of destiny,not in wild confessions under the rain.Sometimes it hides in the quiet ways a person makes you feel seen,heard,valued.Sometimes love doesn’t shout — it breathes.But doubt can be loud.Especially when the person you love softly says,“I’m not feeling attached.”That sentence feels like a crack running through your ribs.but because it makes you question your own heart.You begin wondering —if she feels detached, maybe this ache you feel isn’t love…maybe it’s just fear,loneliness,habit,or the need to be chosen for once.But then you think of her —not the idea of her,not the comfort of her presence,just her.Her kindness that doesn’t try to impress anyone,her softness that feels like a safe place to rest your forehead,the gentleness in her voice when she talks to you differently than she talks to the world.There is a warmth in the way she treats you,almost as if she’s unknowingly healing parts of youyou had accepted would never be healed.And suddenly the doubt loses its strength.Because attachment doesn’t do this.Attachment doesn’t make you care about someone’s silence.Attachment doesn’t make you notice the tremble in their voice when they’re anxious.Attachment doesn’t make you soften your own anger just to protect their peace.Attachment doesn’t make you remember every small thing they ever said to you.",
